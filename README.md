### Abstract

China’s Belt and Road Initiative has boosted trade and investment between China and Africa, causing Western unease and doubts of China’s investment behavior in the region. This study analyzed China’s investment in 44 African countries between 2005 and 2020 using the GMM model to examine the impact of natural resource endowment, market size, and efficiency on China’s investment in low-income and middle-income and above economies. The findings revealed that China’s investment in Africa is influenced by natural resources, market size, and efficiency, but the influence of natural resources is limited and decreasing as African economies develop. The study also found that China’s direct investment in Africa is driven by market-seeking and efficiency-seeking, in addition to resource-seeking, which is only significant in low-income countries. Overall, there is no evidence of resource plundering in China’s investment in Africa.
